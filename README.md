I am a Ph.D. candidate at UIUC, co-advised by Prof. Klara Nahrstedt from the Computer Science Department and Prof. Chenhui Shao from the Mechanical Science and Engineering Department. My research focuses on the innovative integration of manufacturing, statistics, and artificial intelligence. Recently, I developed a novel federated domain generalization algorithm for condition monitoring (FDG-CM), which has demonstrated promising results. Currently, I am exploring the applications of Large Language and Vision Models in intelligent manufacturing and industrial IoT.
